## About Generic Optimization Workflow

Generic Optimization Workflow (GOW) is a modular framework for structuring optimization problems as reproducible workflows. It supports configurable parameter spaces, objective-driven evaluation, and scalable execution strategies, including high-throughput and HPC environments.

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/CST-Modelling-Tools/generic-optimization-workflow).

The documentation and usage examples can be found in the main repository.
